### How to Calculate Your Cryptocurrency Profit / Loss with the Crypto Profit Calculator App and Convert BTC to Fiat

With this crypto profit calculator, you can find out the profit or loss you could have obtained by investing in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies over time.

To use this bitcoin calculator and determine your cryptocurrency profits (or other digital assets), enter the initial investment you want to calculate and select the cryptocurrency you want to simulate to see the coin price and investment fee.

You can choose other cryptocurrencies that are not included in the dropdown menu, but make sure to enter the exact ticker symbol for the crypto. For example, use "DOGE" instead of "DOGECOIN" or "ETH" instead of "ETHEREUM". Please note that not all cryptocurrencies may be covered by the API.

When selecting the sale date, keep in mind that you may not be able to choose today's date if the markets have not yet closed. In that case, select "Yesterday" as the sale date.

The Bitcoin profit calculator will provide the investment value and coin price both as a profit percentage and the absolute crypto profit gains.

Note that if you choose a date prior to the creation of a particular cryptocurrency, the cryptocurrency calculator may display an error message indicating that the selected date is not found in our historical data.

Additionally, the bitcoin converter / profit loss calculator allows you to choose between euros (EUR) or dollars (USD) when calculating your crypto profits, earnings, or investment exit fees from your cryptocurrency.
