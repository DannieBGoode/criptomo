There are different types of cryptocurrencies, being **Bitcoin** the most famous one (and the first to ever exist).\
L﻿et's review what other types are there:

Hay varios tipos de criptomonedas, siendo la más popular Bitcoin.

<!--EndFragment-->There are several types of cryptocurrencies, including:

1. **Stablecoins**: [Stablecoins](https://criptomo.com/what-are-stablecoins/) are cryptocurrencies that are designed to maintain a stable value. This is often achieved by pegging the stablecoin to a fiat currency or a commodity, such as the US dollar or gold. The value of a stablecoin is meant to remain relatively stable, unlike volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which can fluctuate significantly in value. Stablecoins can be used as a way to store value or as a medium of exchange. Examples of stablecoins include Tether, USDC, and Paxos.
2. **Altcoins**: Altcoins are cryptocurrencies that are alternatives to Bitcoin. These altcoins often have similar features to Bitcoin, but they may have a different underlying technology or use a different consensus mechanism. Examples of altcoins include Ethereum, Litecoin, and [Dogecoin](https://criptomo.com/what-are-memecoins/).
3. **Privacy coins**: Privacy coins are cryptocurrencies that place a strong emphasis on privacy and anonymity. These cryptocurrencies often use technologies like zero-knowledge proofs or ring signatures to obscure the identity of the sender and recipient of a transaction. Examples of privacy coins include Monero, Zcash, and Dash.
4. **Commodity-based cryptocurrencies**: These are cryptocurrencies that are backed by a physical commodity, such as [gold](https://criptomo.com/gold-backed-crypto/) or oil. The value of the cryptocurrency is tied to the value of the underlying commodity.
5. **Securities-based cryptocurrencies**: These are cryptocurrencies that represent ownership in a company or asset. They are similar to traditional securities, such as stocks or bonds, and are subject to regulation as such.
6. **U﻿tility cryptocurrencies**: These are cryptocurrencies that represent access to a certain functionality. For example GOLEM (GNT) allows users to use computing power from other users with idle computers.

It's worth noting that the cryptocurrency market is constantly evolving and new types of cryptocurrencies are being developed all the time. As such, it's important to keep an eye on developments in the cryptocurrency space and be aware of the different types of cryptocurrencies that are available.
