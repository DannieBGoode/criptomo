Although some concepts are touched on, this book does not explain in detail how Bitcoin works, but it does give the right context to understand why Bitcoin exists and what problem it solves.

The continuation of the Bitcoin Standard looks at fiat money and its transition from the gold standard to the current one. Saifedean Ammous draws an analogy between bitcoin and fiat money by studying the current financial system from the perspective of cryptocurrency.
