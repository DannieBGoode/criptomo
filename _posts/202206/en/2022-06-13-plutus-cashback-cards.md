You can get the card and receive $10 free with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://dex.plutus.it/auth/referee/signup?refId=DwlxOh">code DwlxOh</a>.

With the delive of Crypto .com and the degradation of its benefits, many have turned their attention to other alternatives and Plutus is one of the most striking of all.

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://dex.plutus.it/auth/referee/signup?refId=DwlxOh">Plutus</a> is a debit card that we can load with cryptocurrencies (`ETH` , `PLU`) and receive up to 8% cashback on all our purchases. Even up to 9% cashback if we combine it with [Curve](/guide-curve-crypto/) (explained at the end of the article).

## Subscriptions

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://dex.plutus.it/auth/referee/signup?refId=DwlxOh">Plutus</a> follows a Freemium model and therefore has a free plan that already in case it offers a 3% cashback (although limited) and several payment plans:

### Starter

The Beginner subscription is **free** and offers the following benefits:

- 3% Cashback of up to $250 spent.
- 1 Perk to choose valued at $10 per month.

Total possible returns: $17.50 per month.

### Everyday

The Daily subscription costs **$4.99 per month** and offers the following benefits:

- 3% Cashback of up to $2,000 spent.
- 2 Perks to choose valued at $10 per month.

Total possible returns: $80 per month.

###Premium

The Premium subscription costs **$14.99 per month** and offers the following benefits.

- 3% Cashback of up to $22,500 spent.
- 3 Perks to choose valued at $10 per month.

Total possible returns: $705 per month.

## stake

The above benefits can be drastically optimized by staking. Staking can be done directly from metamask or a compatible [hardware wallet](/crypto-wallets/) which means that our funds will not be in danger.

{% include image_caption.html imageurl="/images/posts/202206/staking-plutus.webp" title="Staking improves our chosen plan regardless of which one we take." caption="Staking improves our chosen plan regardless of which one we take." popup=true %}

In this way the benefits would be as follows depending on the staking level:

- **Hero**: If we stake 250 `PLU` we would have a 4% cashback and 4 Perks available.
- **Veteran**: If we stake 500 `PLU` we would have a 5% cashback and 5 Perks available.
- **Legend**: If we stake 1000 `PLU` we would have a 6% cashback and 6 Perks available.
- **GOAT**: If we stake 2000 `PLU` we would have 8% cashback and 8 Perks available.

In this way, the table of possible total returns depending on the subscription and the staking level would look like this:

<div markdown="block" style="overflow: auto;">
| Staking     | Staking  | Cashback | Perks | Starter | Everyday | Premium |
|:-----------:|:--------:|:--------:|:-----:|:-------:|:--------:|:-------:|
| -           | 0 PLU    | 3%       | 1-3   | 17.50$  | 80$      | 705$    |
| **Hero**    | 250 PLU  | 4%       | 4     | 50$     | 120$     | 940$    |
| **Veteran** | 500 PLU  | 5%       | 5     | 62.5$   | 150$     | 1175$   |
| **Legend**  | 1000 PLU | 6%       | 6     | 75$     | 180$     | 1410$   |
| **GOAT**    | 2000 PLU | 8%       | 8     | 100     | 240$     | 1880$   |

##Perks

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://dex.plutus.it/auth/referee/signup?refId=DwlxOh">Plutus</a> allows you to choose between several Perks (additional benefits) to add to the return that gives us the cashback.

{% include image_caption.html imageurl="/images/posts/202206/perks.webp" title="Each one of these perks would return us up to $10 of what we spend on these services using the Plutus card" caption="Each one of these perks would return us up to $10 of what we spend on these services using the Plutus card" popup=true %}

That is, if we are subscribed, for example, to Netflix using the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://dex.plutus.it/auth/referee/signup?refId=DwlxOh">Plutus</a> card . $10 per month will be returned to us each time the subscription is charged to the card.

The user can choose which Perk benefits him more depending on which card he has in operation and the refund will be made in the official Plutus cryptocurrency called `PLU`.

We can convert that `PLU` to EUR and put it in the balance of our card.

## Hidden costs

The costs of all operations can be seen on <a href="https://plutus.it/fees" rel="nofollow">the Plutus website</a>.

The $0.15 per denied transaction is noteworthy, as is the $15 fixed cost for withdrawing `PLU` outside the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://dex.plutus.it/auth/referee/ ecosystem signup?refId=DwlxOh">Plutus</a>, although both actions are things that in principle should not happen often.

## How to put money on the card

Unlike other cards like Crypto or Revolut, it is not possible to put money through another card, which is in my opinion the biggest flaw that this card has.

There are two ways to put money on the card:
- Through a traditional bank transfer.
- Sending in `ETH`, or `PLU` and converting it to fiat.

## How to Optimize Plutus cards with Curve

One of the Perks available is the refund of the subscription of [Curve](/guide-curve-crypto/), so we could subscribe for free to the first level of Curve receiving an additional 1% in cashback in three businesses to choose .

Curve also allows you to enter any card in Apple Pay / Google Pay / Samsung Pay so we would not need to carry the card <a rel="nofollow" href="https://dex.plutus.it/auth/referee/signup? refId=DwlxOh">Plutus</a> physically.

Also, with Curve's *Back In Time* functionality we won't have to worry about always having funds on our card, which is the most inconvenient part of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://dex.plutus.it /auth/referee/signup?refId=DwlxOh">Plutus</a>, because we can re-do and undo transactions as we see fit to optimize our cashback.

## How to get the card

The card is available in the United Kingdom and the European Union (EU). You can get the card and receive $10 free with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://dex.plutus.it/auth/referee/signup?refId=DwlxOh">code DwlxOh</a>.
