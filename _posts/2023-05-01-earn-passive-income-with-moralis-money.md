2. Moralis Money is made by people who have a good track record trading altcoins (for example Ivan on Tech was one of the first people to get into MATIC at just a few cents).Â **Other platforms that try to compete with us often are made by data-scientists without trading experience. Their tools don't help you become successful in crypto, they just provide information overload.**
