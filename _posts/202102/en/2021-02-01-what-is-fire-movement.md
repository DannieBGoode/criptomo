There is no law that requires people to work until they are 65+ years old, much less in a job that we do not like. That is why there is a wave of young people joining the F.I.R.E. (Financial Independence Retire Early).

<!--more-->

The goal of this move is to aggressively save as much money as possible in order to be able to retire as soon as possible. How old? That will depend on your expenses and how suddenly you start saving, but there are some by retiring before the age of 40.

Once that FIRE status is reached, we can stop working, or work in a lower paying but more exciting job. We should not necessarily imagine ourselves lying on the beach for the rest of our lives, but we certainly have a much more relaxed life where we will not have to do anything with which we do not agree.

### How is it done?

- **Minimize expenses**, stop buying products that we do not need to impress others or feel better about ourselves. Do we really need the latest iPhone? Or some new pants?

- **Allocate most of our savings to the stock market**. The easiest thing is to invest in an index fund, for example the S & P500. Try to invest every month consistently.

- We use the [FIRE calculator](/en/fire-calculator/) to **calculate how much money we need**. If we have doubts about how to use it, we indicate the SWR withdrawal method with a rate of 4%, and the estimated annual expenses for the rest of our life once withdrawn. The calculator will tell us at what age we can retire and how much money we will have saved then.


### But can't I lose money if I invest in the stock market?

Investing in the stock market in the long term and with a head is very difficult to lose money. Now, how do you invest with your head? It really is very easy, **instead of choosing the hot stocks ourselves, we are going to choose an index fund**, like the S & P500 and invest every month regardless of the market. We will not withdraw this money unless we have a catastrophic emergency, at least not until after our withdrawal begins.

Historically, the return of the S & P500 from 1926 to 2018 has been 10-11% annualized, that is, compensating bad years with new ones. As long as we have the discipline not to withdraw money when things go wrong, we can reap the rewards when they go well.

### What is the 4% withdrawal method?

The 4% rule comes from the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_study"> Trinity Study </a>, conducted by the Texas Trinity University of Finance. What this study indicates is that if 4% of our financial portfolio invested in an index is enough to cover our annual expenses, we will never run out of money, since the S & P500 in the long term has always given annualized returns of 10%.

### What if I have unexpected expenses during my retirement?

It is difficult to foresee future events, consider if your country offers public health and if you would be safe if you had a disease in the future. If not, include health insurance in your annual expenses.

You can also play with the calculator with a lower withdrawal rate (3.5%) or with higher annual expenses to leave a margin of error, although this means withdrawing later but more safely.

Alternatively, if a bad year comes, 3% could be withdrawn instead of 4% for the duration of the crisis.
