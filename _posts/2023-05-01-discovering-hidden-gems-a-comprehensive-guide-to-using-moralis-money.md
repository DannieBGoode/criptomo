## Introducing [Moralis Money](https://moralismoney.com/?ref=nzvlodi&tapid=danielcalatayud&program=moralis-money)

Moralis Money is an advanced cryptocurrency analysis tool engineered to assist users in effortlessly discovering high-potential cryptocurrencies, often referred to as hidden gems. With its customizable filters and user-friendly interface, Moralis Money enables users to identify prospective investments and conduct in-depth research prior to making decisions. This comprehensive guide outlines the process of utilizing Moralis Money proficiently to explore the cryptocurrency landscape.

## Purpose of [Moralis Money](https://moralismoney.com/?ref=nzvlodi&tapid=danielcalatayud&program=moralis-money)

During a bull market, the average altcoin typically experiences gains between 50x and 70x, with some coins even achieving 100x or 1000x returns. These impressive increases generally occur within relatively short periods. Consequently, focusing on altcoins is essential for individuals seeking accelerated wealth growth.

By preparing ahead of time for the altcoin season and strategically timing your entry, you can capitalize on extraordinary price surges, such as:

* Cardano (ADA) increased by over 170x in less than 18 months.
* Fantom (FTM) appreciated by more than 2236x in under 15 months.
* Polygon (MATIC) saw a 5544x growth in less than 15 months.

Investing merely $100 in each of the above three altcoins could have yielded $795,000 in under two years. The most challenging aspect is identifying the right altcoins before their value surges.

## How to Use Moralis Money

### Step 1: Create a [Moralis Money Account](https://moralismoney.com/?ref=nzvlodi&tapid=danielcalatayud&program=moralis-money)

Begin by creating an account on the Moralis Money website. Once registered, log in to access the platform's features.

Moralis Money provides an extensive array of filters to help refine your search for hidden gems. Start by selecting an initial criterion, such as searching for all coins minted within the last 50 days. Then, apply additional filters like the security score, which evaluates the safety of a coin based on various factors.

Examples of filters you can apply include:

* **Coin Age**: Discover coins minted within a specific timeframe.
* **Security Score**: Identify coins with a minimum security score for added safety. This score is calculated using [Dext Tools](https://dextools.medium.com/comments-and-tips-about-dext-score-7f6cfd628ee2) and the higher it is, the less probable it is that the project ends up being a scam. You can also apply the “Security Score” filter to get Token Explorer to return only coins that are less risky. For instance, you can focus on tokens with a security score of 80 or higher

* **Market Cap**: Search for coins based on their market capitalization.
* **Experienced Buyers**: Seek coins with a history of experienced buyers to avoid spoofed addresses.

Stay informed about new features and filters added to Moralis Money to enhance your search capabilities.

### Step 4: Conduct Due Diligence with Additional Tools

Once you have identified a promising coin on Moralis Money, it is crucial to conduct further research to evaluate its investment potential. Utilize tools like DexTools to analyze the coin's chart, liquidity, and security metrics, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the coin's performance and potential risks.

Consider the following factors during your research:

* Liquidity: Ensure the coin has adequate liquidity, preferably with locked liquidity.
* Contract Security: Examine the contract code for potential vulnerabilities or red flags.
* Distribution: Review the coin's distribution among its holders.
* Trading History: Assess the coin's trading history for trends or anomalies.

### Step 5: Manage Risk and Adopt a Long-Term Approach

When using Moralis Money, prioritize long-term success and focus on mastering the tool before making trades. Implement risk management strategies to safeguard your investments. For instance, consider exiting a coin if its value decreases by more than 20%.

Bear in mind that trading newly minted coins carries a high-risk, high-reward nature. While Moralis Money offers valuable metrics and tools for informed decision-making, always remain cognizant of the inherent risks associated with cryptocurrency trading.
